Larger vehicles have increased blind spots. Transit vehicles have more prominent blind spots due
to their size compared to regular cars. While itâ€™s essential to be cautious about blind spots when
driving a car, twice as much caution is of the essence when operating even larger vehicles. This
project focuses on developing a hybrid system to monitor blind spots around these vehicles using
advanced sensors and technology.
The Blind Spot Monitoring System has sensors strategically placed on the vehicle`s exterior, which
can detect objects in the blind spot zones. These sensors collect real-time data and relay it to a
central processing unit, which then analyzes the information to determine potential risks or
obstacles in the blind spots.
To warn the driver, the system uses intuitive visual and audible signals. When the system detects
a vehicle or object in the blind spot, it immediately notifies the driver about the location and
proximity of the potential hazard. The alerts are designed to be clear and easily noticeable,
allowing the driver to take appropriate action, such as adjusting their lane position or delaying a
lane change until it is safe.
Through the implementation of a hybrid Blind Spot Monitoring System, the project aims to
minimize the occurrence of accidents caused by blind spot-related incidents involving large
vehicles. By providing drivers with timely and accurate information about potential hazards in
their blind spots, this system enhances overall road safety and reduces the risk of collisions,
benefiting both the vehicle operators and other road user.
